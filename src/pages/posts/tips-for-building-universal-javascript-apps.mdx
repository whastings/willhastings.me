title: Tips for Building Universal JavaScript Apps
date: 2016-12-1
---

Following in the footsteps of some great JavaScript developers like [Nicolás
Bevacqua][ponyfoo], I've built my own, over-engineered blog. In my case, I built
it as a single-page application running on React and Redux client-side and
Express server-side.  While the endeavor hasn't been the most practical I've
ever undertaken (a blog hardly needs to be a SPA), it's been extremely helpful
to me in learning an awesome technology stack.

One challenge I wanted to tackle as part of this project was to get my blogging
app to support both server-side and client-side rendering (make it a "universal"
app). In my experience, server-side rendering is great for enabling a quick
initial render and client-side rendering is great for quick subsequent page
views. As part of achieving this goal, I discovered a few handy tips. I'm going
to share these in the hopes they'll be of help to others.

## Abstract API Calls

A universal app is easiest to understand when the amount of conditional logic
creating separate code branches for the server-side and the client-side is kept
to a minimum. But obviously some things have to be done differently in these
different environments. On the client, we make Ajax requests and render DOM. On
the server, we load data from a database and render a string of HTML to send to
the client. For the view layer, a library like React is great for keeping
conditional logic away. You pretty much write your components in a client-side
mindset and React will take care of what not to do server-side (e.g. setting up
event listeners). For other concerns, you have to come up with your own
abstraction to limit environment-based conditionals.

An important concern is how you make API calls to fetch your data. As said, this
requires an Ajax request client-side and database calls server-side. To keep
this simple for my universal application, I found the best approach was to
abstract API calls into a separate object that can be passed into the
application as a dependency. The application defines a client-side version of
this object as a set of functions that make Ajax requests to the server and
return promises. If no other API object is provided to the application, it uses
this one by default. The server-side code also defines an API object that
returns promises, but it makes database calls instead of Ajax calls. Since the
server-side version has the exact same interface as the client-side version, the
server can simply pass it to the application when running it server-side.

Let's look at some code examples to illustrate this approach:

I've constructed [the entry point of my application][app-class] as a class that
can be instantiated:

```javascript
class App {
  constructor(options) {
    this.options = options;
    options.api = options.api || appApi;
    this.store = createStore(options.api);
    // ...
  }

  // ...
}
```

The `App` class is responsible for, among other things, instantiating the Redux
store and making the API object available to it, which it then makes available
to action creators through a [custom async action
middleware][async-action-middleware]. An action creator will call a function
from the API object and return its promise for the middleware to track. As an
example, consider this action creator that loads posts:

```javascript
export function loadPosts(options) {
  return (api) =>
    api.getPosts(options)
      .then((posts) => ({type: 'POSTS_ADD', payload: posts}));
}
```

The action creator returns a function that the middleware then invokes with the
API object. The function then calls an API function and returns its promise,
chaining onto it to specify an action to dispatch after the posts are loaded.

Let's look at the client-side implementation of this API function:

```javascript
export default {
  // ...

  getPosts(queryParams = null) {
    let url = '/api/posts';
    url = queryParams ? url + stringifyQueryParams(queryParams) : url;
    return getJSON(url);
  },

  // ...
};
```

Besides dealing with some query parameters (which I use to load unpublished
posts in the admin view), this API function simply delegates to a
[`getJSON`][get-json] utility for making an Ajax request and returning parsed
JSON.

Now let's consider the server-side implementation:

```javascript
export default {
  // ...

  getPosts({includeUnpublished = false} = {}) {
    let conditions = includeUnpublished ? {} : {published: true};
    let cacheKey = conditions.published ? CACHE_KEY_POSTS_ALL : CACHE_KEY_POSTS;

    return cacheOrQuery(
      cacheKey,
      () => Post.model.findAll({where: conditions})
        .then(formatters.postList)
    );
  },

  // ...
};
```

Besides some additional caching logic to minimize database access, the
server-side version of the API function is still pretty simple, and it adheres
to the same interface as the client-side version.

With this setup, the action creator in the app will simply call the server-side
version directly when the app is run server-side. When running client-side, it
will make an Ajax request and the [server-side routing code][posts-server] will
use the API object to load data for a response:

```javascript
app.get('/', asyncRoute(function* postsRouteIndex(req, res) {
  let options = {includeUnpublished: !!req.query.includeUnpublished};

  if (options.includeUnpublished && !req.currentUser) {
    res.status(401).end();
    return;
  }

  res.json(yield api.getPosts(options));
}));
```

Overall, I find this to be an elegant approach to managing data access for a
universal app. The only downside I've found is that it's sometimes necessary to
duplicate authorization logic between client and server. For example, I have a
both a [client-side authorization middleware][client-auth-mw] and a [server-side
authorization middleware][server-auth-mw]. An alternative to this would be to
use something like [isomorphic-fetch][iso-fetch] so that the app makes HTTP
requests both client-side and server-side. This would allow all the
authorization logic to be captured in the server-side request handling code.
Even when taking this alternative into consideration, I currently prefer the
abstract API object method, as it make it unnecessary to take on the overhead of
running additional server routes when the app is running server-side. Though I
reserve the right to change my mind.

## Abstract Rendering and Other Environment-Dependent Operations

Continuing in the vein of the previous section, I also found it necessary to
abstract how the application handles a few other concerns: rendering, redirects,
page not found, and errors. All of these require specialized handling that is
environment-dependent. Rendering must use `ReactDOM.render()` client-side and
`renderToString()` server-side. Redirects must be implemented as HTTP redirects
server-side and as a route transition client-side. A page not found should
result in a special page rendered from both environments, but with a 404 HTTP
status returned on the server-side. Errors need to be logged differently
depending on the environment. As before, my goal is to minimize
environment-based conditionals in my application code.

My approach to handling these concerns was to pass callbacks as options to my
`App` class that it can then invoke when it encounters these particular
scenarios:

```javascript
class App {
  constructor(options) {
    this.options = options;
    options.api = options.api || appApi;
    this.store = createStore(options.api);
    // ...
  }

  handleError(error) {
    let { onError } = this.options;

    if (onError) {
      onError(error);
    }
  }

  redirect(path) {
    this.options.onRedirect(path);
  }

  render(Component, props = {}) {
    this.options.renderer(
      <Provider store={this.store}>
        <UI>
          <Component {...props}/>
        </UI>
      </Provider>
    );
  }

  render404() {
    let { on404 } = this.options;

    if (on404) {
      on404();
    }

    this.render(Page404);
  }

  // ...
}
```

As you can see, `App` has methods for handling these concerns, and each method
delegates to the appropriate callback that was provided to the app on
instantiation. This way, the server can pass in appropriate functions when
instantiating the app:

```javascript
let app = new App({
  renderer: (element) => {
    res.render('base', {
      assets: res.assets,
      csrfToken: req.csrfToken(),
      data: JSON.stringify(app.store.getState()),
      html: renderToString(element),
      isDev: IS_DEV
    });
  },
  onRedirect: res.redirect.bind(res),
  onError: next,
  on404: () => res.status(404),
  api
});
```

In the server's case, it uses React's `renderToString` to render the app as an
HTML string, which it then passes to Express's rendering logic. For redirects,
it uses the Express response object's `redirect()` method. For errors, it passes
the Express route's `next()` callback, which will register an error if invoked
with an argument. And for page not found, it simply sets a 404 status for the
HTTP response.

On the client-side, appropriate handlers can also be passed in when running the
initialization logic:

```javascript
app = new App({
  renderer: appRenderer,
  onRedirect: page,
  onError: errorHandler
});

function appRenderer(element) {
  ReactDOM.render(element, rootEl);
}

function errorHandler(error) {
  console.error && console.error(error);
}
```

In this version, the `appRenderer` function will call `ReactDOM.render()`.
`onRedirect` will trigger a route transition (I'm using [Page.js][page-js] for
routing). For error handling, I'm currently just logging to `console.error()`,
though in the future I hope to send errors to the server via Ajax for real
production logging. In the client's case, I've omitted an `on404` callback, as
the default app behavior of rendering the 404 page is sufficient.

## Use Separate Builds for Client and Server

I'm a huge fan of modern JavaScript's syntax and latest standard library
additions (ES2015 and beyond). So naturally I want to use some of these niceties
in writing my application's code. This of course makes
[transpilation][transpilation-article] necessary, as not all syntax and library
features are available in every environment.

In addition to the need for transpilation, a modern JS app also needs its
modules built and managed in a way that's appropriate for its target environment
(or environments in my case). For my app code, I prefer to use [ES6
modules][es6-modules]. And besides your application code, you need a way to
build and bundle all the third-party libraries you depend on. Finally, there are
non-JavaScript assets you likely also need to manage, such as CSS files written
with Sass.

My top choice for handling these concerns is [Webpack][webpack]. It's a
feature-rich and extensible tool that handles all these needs efficiently. When
it comes to building my app so it can run server-side and client-side, I've
found the best approach is to output two builds: one optimized for the browser
and one optimized for the server.

To facilitate this, I have a [Webpack configuration for the
client][webpack-client] and a [Webpack configuration for the
server][webpack-server]. Both share a few values from a [shared
configuration][webpack-shared] and then diverge to configure an optimized build
for each environment. For example, I can take advantage of Webpack's
`CommonsChunkPlugin` for the client build to pull third-party code and
commonly-used utilities into their own JS files. And for the server, I can
output the app as a CommonJS module for easy use in Node and configure Webpack
to optimize for the Node environment:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  entry: {
    app: './app/index.jsx'
  },

  output: Object.assign({}, shared.output, {
    path: path.join(shared.output.path, 'server'),
    library: 'app',
    libraryTarget: 'commonjs2'
  }),

  resolve: shared.resolve,
  target: 'node',

  // ...
};
```

You may think this means I have to run Webpack twice each time I build, but
Webpack will accept an array of configuration objects and then run all of them
during one execution. Here's what my top-level configuration file that I pass to
Webpack looks like:

```javascript
module.exports = [
  require('./webpack/client.config'),
  require('./webpack/server.config')
];
```

Let's look a little closer at how using separate build configurations allows me
to optimize build output for each environment.

### Handling Transpilation

As I mentioned before, I need to transpile my application code so I can take
advantage of the latest and greatest capabilities of the JavaScript language.
But that doesn't mean I need to transpile in the same way for the server and for
the client. I'm using Node.js version 6 to run my server-side code, which has
[excellent ES6 support][node6-es6]. It needs very little transpiled, mostly just
bleeding-edge features like [Object spread][object-spread]. For the client,
however, I want to support even some older browsers that don't support any ES6
features, and so I want to transpile the code entirely to ES5. Using separate
build configurations, it's easy to set up optimal transpilation for both
environments.

I'm using [Babel][babel] for transpilation since it's become the industry
standard tool. For the client, I'm using
[babel-preset-es2015][babel-preset-es2015] and
[babel-preset-react][babel-preset-react] to transpile my app code for widest
browser support. For the server, I'm using
[babel-preset-es2015-node][babel-preset-es2015-node] and babel-preset-react to
transpile only the features that Node version 6 doesn't already support.

I think it makes sense to only transpile as much as needed, and take advantage
of native feature support when it's available. Babel's excellent preset system
combined with my two-build setup makes it easy for me to produce the best bundle
for client and server.

### Handling Styles

I also want to call out handling styles during build. For my styles, I'm using
Sass to write my CSS and Webpack to run it through the Sass compiler. This
allows me to declare styling dependencies directly in my JavaScript modules,
which I think helps with keeping dependencies explicit and related code
together. For example, I have a `PostPage/index.jsx` module that defines a
`PostPage` component and also declares a dependency on the
`PostPage/styles.scss` Sass file that lives next to it.

```javascript
import './styles.scss';
import React from 'react';
import SafeOutput from 'app/utils/components/SafeOutput';

export default function PostPage({post}) {
  return (
    <section className="post-view-page post">
      <h2 className="page-title">{post.title}</h2>

      <SafeOutput className="post__body card" content={post.body}/>
    </section>
  );
}
```

But this poses an issue when it comes to outputting a build of the app to run
server-side. Styles aren't needed in that environment. Thankfully, there's a
handy [null-loader][null-loader] for Webpack you can use to ignore a file type
during a build. I simply apply it to Sass files in my server build configuration
and the issue is no more (Note that I'm using [Webpack 2 beta's new
configuration API][webpack2-api]).

```javascript
module.exports = {
  // ...

  module: {
    rules: [
      // ...

      {
        test: /\.scss$/,
        use: [
          'null-loader'
        ]
      }
    ]
  },
};
```

Now I don't need to worry about styles for the server-side and for the
client-side I can configure advanced tools like Autoprefixer for my styles.

## Enable Hot-Reloading of the App Server-Side during Development

The last tip I have pertains to reloading app code during development on the
server-side. For my actual server code, I use [Nodemon][nodemon] to
automatically restart my server when I change code. But for built application
code, I instead hot-reload it server-side so I don't even need a server restart
to pick up changes (which is safe because I re-instantiate the app for each
request). To do this, I use the [require-reload module][require-reload], which
removes a module from Node's require cache so the next time it's required, it
reruns from scratch. I capture loading of the app in a utility function which
clears the cache for the app's built JS when in development:

```javascript
const IS_DEV = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development';

let App = require(APP_SRC);

module.exports = function loadApp() {
  if (IS_DEV) {
    let srcFiles = fs.readdirSync(APP_DIST_DIR);
    srcFiles.forEach((file) => reload(`${APP_DIST_DIR}/${file}`));
    App = require(APP_SRC);
  }

  return App.default;
};
```

Note that there are multiple JS files even for the server side build because I'm
using Webpack's code-splitting functionality to lazy-load code client-side and
this unfortunately results in split code for the server too.
